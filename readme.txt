Jorge Vittes, of Carnegie Mellon University. If there are
any questions please address it to them, or to Guy Blelloch
also of Carnegie Mellon University. 

It should be noted that as of September 2004, Umut Acar will
be moving to The Toyota Technology Institute in Chicago, IL, 
and Jorge Vittes will be moving to Stanford University in 
Stanford, CA.
