This directory contains the code for Rake-And-Compress trees
as of 7/6/2004.

Basically all the code here was written by Umut Acar, and 
Jorge Vittes, of Carnegie Mellon University. 

In order to compile an application, copy the Application.c 
Application.h, Data.c, Data.h, and Test.c files from the 
particular application directory, and all other files from the
root directory to a common directory, then compile them 
together.
