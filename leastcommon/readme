Given a root $r$ and two vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$, we can find the
least common ancestor of $v_1$ and $v_2$ with respect to the root $r$
by walking the tree up from all tree vertices simultaneously until
they all meet and then walking down two of the paths to find the least
common ancestor.  Consider the cluster $c$ that all three paths meet.
If this is the first cluster that any two clusters meet, then the
corresponding vertex is the least common ancestor.  Otherwise, one of
the children of $c$ contains two clusters, move down to that cluster.
Now follow the path down until the two paths split.  If it is a binary
cluster, proceed to the cluster pointing in the direction of the the
vertex whose path has joined last.  Now follow the path down to the
first unary cluster, the corresponding vertex is the least common
ancestor.  If the paths split at a unary cluster, and both path
continue to unary clusters, the corresponding vertex is the least
common ancestor.  Otherwise, continue to the binary cluster and follow
the path down to the first unary cluster, whose corresponding vertex
is the least common ancestor.
