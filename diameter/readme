The diameter of a tree is defined as the length of the longest path in the
tree.  To compute the diameter, we tag each cluster with its diameter and
the length of the longest path starting at each boundary vertex.  We also
tag each binary cluster with the length of its cluster path.  The root
will be tagged with diameter of the whole tree.  It is straightforward to
define the rake, compress, and finalize operations for this purpose.
